## Forest-Cop-Ter: A multipurpose drone

This project was carried out over 2 semesters thus was divided into two parts.

**Part1:**

Our main purpose was to build a Drone from scratch and be able to make it fly. Thus, we built a F450 Quadcopter usin KK 2.1.5 Flight Controller , also as an application we designed a delivery system for it using servo motor.

**Part2:**

For the next semester we decided to upgrade the drone .To deploy it into the forest sector so that it can come handy for the Forest Rescue Department. Thus following were the features that were customized into it:

- Camera Surveillance using Raspberry Pi
- Calling system using GSM Module
- Forest Fire prediction system
- GPS Location
- First Aid Box that opens through servo motor
- All these applications could be observed or controlled through GUI APP.
